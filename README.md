## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/atulguptag/Django-eCommerce-Website.git](https://github.com/Charishma608/Ecommerce_Django.git)
   cd Django-eCommerce-Website
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### `Note`: Before running `python manage.py migrate`, first create `.env` file in your project root, and update it with the same as `.env.example`

- Then, add `SECRET_KEY` and `DEBUG=True` in `.env` file -

- **How to generate/get the SECRET_KEY?**

- Open your terminal (make sure your virtual environment is activated, it should be something like this - `(venv) PS C:\Users\asus\Django-eCommerce-Website`)

- then type `django-admin shell`, and hit enter.

- Paste the below code into your shell (use mouse right side button to paste the copied code, `as Ctrl+V may not work`)-

  ```bash
  from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
  get_random_secret_key()
  ```

* Copy the `SECRET_KEY`(whatever you got in the output), and paste it in your `.env` file after `SECRET_KEY=`.

* Now, you are good to go :) -

5. **Apply database migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a superuser (admin):**

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
